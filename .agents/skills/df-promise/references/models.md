# Model configuration

Resolve models before substantive work or any model preflight. Defaults live in
this skill's `SKILL.md`: Easy Loop uses the `agents` entries in its workflow;
other skills use `model_defaults`. Overlay these files in order, field by field:

1. `~/.config/diffusion/skills/models.yaml`
2. `<project-dir>/.diffusion/skills/models.yaml`

The project file wins; omitted roles and fields retain their lower-layer values.
Missing, blank, or comment-only files mean no overrides. An empty mapping
(`{}`) is also valid. Malformed
YAML, duplicate keys, unknown roles for this skill, and invalid model/effort
values are errors; report them before launching. Entries for other skills are
ignored. `reasoning_effort: null` explicitly removes an inherited effort flag.

Both files use the same schema (include only the overrides you want):

```yaml
skills:
  df-easy-loop-e2e:
    coding:
      model: gpt-6-astra
      reasoning_effort: high
  df-easy-loop-simple:
    plan:
      model: claude-fable-5-1
  df-sprint-plan:
    claude:
      model: claude-fable-5-1
  df-sprint-execute:
    codex:
      model: gpt-6-astra
  df-chapter-create:
    main:
      model: claude-fable-5-1
  df-semantic-index:
    reader:
      model: gpt-6-astra
  df-promise:
    main:
      model: gpt-6-astra
```

Use the bundled `scripts/resolve_models.py` next to the **loaded** `SKILL.md`;
do not search for a different installation. It requires Python 3.
Default-only operation works with the standard library. Reading YAML overrides
requires PyYAML; if unavailable, install it in a dedicated environment:

```bash
python3 -m venv ~/.local/share/diffusion/skills/venv
~/.local/share/diffusion/skills/venv/bin/python -m pip install PyYAML
```

Run with that environment's Python (or another Python with PyYAML). Substitute
the actual installed skill directory and target project root:

```text
<python> <loaded-skill-dir>/scripts/resolve_models.py \
  --project-dir <project-dir>
```

The target is the project being worked on, never the skill installation or an
Easy Loop visit directory. When `--project-dir` is omitted, the resolver uses
the enclosing Git worktree root, or the current directory outside Git. For a
non-Git project invoked from a subdirectory, supply its root explicitly.
`--user-config <file>` exists for isolated tests; normal runs use the fixed
user path above regardless of `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` or `CODEX_HOME`.

The JSON output includes each role's resolved `model`, `cli`, `model_args` argv
list, and per-field `sources`. Report the effective assignments briefly.
Use these exact model/effort arguments in preflight, fresh, resumed, draft,
critique, and execution calls; shell-quote each argument when using a shell.
Do not pass both template defaults and resolved flags. Preserve the skill's
existing permissions, working directories, prompts, and routing.

Easy Loop roles may switch between `claude-` (Claude Code) and `gpt-` (Codex)
models. Choose the CLI and effort flag from the resolved assignment. Resolve
once after startup inputs, save the JSON as `setup/resolved-models.json`, and
reuse it for the whole run including resumed visits. Keep using the original
installed helper when copying `SKILL.md` into the run directory.

The `claude`, `codex`, and `gemini` sprint roles keep their provider lanes.
Their `main` role handles orchestration: planning also uses it for interview
and merge; execution uses it for review. Gemini
uses `agy`; its `cli-default` sentinel preserves agy's configured model by
omitting `--model`. Set `gemini.model` to a concrete `gemini-...` identifier to
pin it. Never pass the sentinel as a model ID.

The `main` role defaults to `inherit`, meaning the invoking agent. It cannot
switch its own model by saying so: when resolved to a concrete model, hand the
skill to one foreground CLI worker using the resolved arguments. Give it the
loaded skill path, original request/arguments, target directory, resolved JSON,
and this marker: "Model-selected main worker: main selection is already
applied; do not delegate main again." That worker performs the skill and its
normal interactions; relay any required user questions and resume the same
worker with the answers. Keep existing scope and permissions. A marked worker
uses the supplied assignments instead of resolving or re-delegating main.

`df-semantic-index` also has `reader`. With `inherit`, readers use the effective
main worker's model; a concrete override applies to every segment reader via
the matching CLI (or a runtime worker that can honor that exact model). Its
normal parallel-read threshold and batch limit still apply. `inherit` accepts
no effort override; choose a concrete model to configure effort.

For `df-promise`, a contract requiring a named model or independent reviewer
still applies. A conflicting override is a configuration conflict to report,
not permission to substitute a different model or discard independence.
