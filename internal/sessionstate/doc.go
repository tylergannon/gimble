// # What this package is
//
// One ordered reduction of the native session events Gimble emits into the
// state produced by the upstream client's event branches. Client cache reads
// and promise completion behavior are outside this server-side projection.
//
// It holds no Gimble identity. Run, conversation and invocation identity
// live outside the native event; the caller dispatches to a projection
// before applying a payload, so native IDs cannot collide across concurrent
// invocations.
//
// # What this package is not
//
// The upstream store also caches projects, locations, agents, commands,
// models, providers, shells and skills. Those are excluded: they are
// application caches, not session observation.
