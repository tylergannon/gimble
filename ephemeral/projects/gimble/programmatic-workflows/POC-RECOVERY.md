# Recovered Go library POC and authoring sketches

Recovered and checked on 2026-09-09 after Tyler identified that a new proposal
had missed the earlier implementation. Start here before designing another
Go orchestration API. The shipped Gimble graph engine remains on `main`;
the Go POC exists on a preserved, unmerged branch.

## Read in this order

1. [Actual workflow source](POC-WORKFLOWS.md): the 88-line orchestration file
   after input/prompt separation, copied unchanged from the branch.
2. [Concurrency shapes](CONCURRENCY-SHAPES.md): the earlier proposed
   critique-circle and bake-off algorithms using ordinary `errgroup` and
   synchronous typed operations. This document is restored unchanged;
   its Tractor names and present-tense POC status refer to that branch.
3. [New Go-library sketches](GO-LIBRARY-SKETCHES.md): the later proposal for
   roles, arbitrary Polytype inputs, an additive migration, and a curated
   catalog. Tyler rejected its level of indirection. Its API names are
   hypothetical and need revision against the earlier work.

## What was implemented

The `program` library already contains typed `Codergen[T]`, command execution,
command-plus-inference validation, and
`Loop(...) iter.Seq2[Iteration, error]` over the existing checklist format.
The iterator owns validation and `done` reconciliation; ordinary Go owns
implementation, review, repair, and nesting. Validation is a callback, so
callers can also supply ordinary Go validation functions.

`program/workflows` implements sprint execution, nested chapter execution,
and delivery. Input validation/dispatch, configuration/defaults, prompts,
and typed step adapters are separate from the workflow algorithms.
`tractor program schema <name>` and `tractor program run <name> --input ...`
already formed a separate argument-schema/invocation path beside the graph
CLI. These are commands in the historical POC, not current Gimble commands.

The POC is not complete graph-engine parity. Scoped automatic context,
concurrent call ownership/isolation, supervisors, native-session continuity,
and a visualizer remained follow-ups. Its input schemas were handwritten;
workflow-owned roles and generated Polytype argument schemas are subsequent
direction. The concurrency sketches explain the concrete per-call
cancellation and invocation-identity problems to resolve before parallel use.

## Recover the complete source

The verified backup is `/Users/tyler/src/gimble-history-backup-20260909.bundle`.
Its `refs/heads/codex/programmatic-workflow-research` points to
`4906a98c44930763597ebe015d5b996c120bc1eb`. This local backup is not a published
Gimble branch; these Markdown copies keep the authoring examples available
without it. The full source requires access to the backup.

Clone into a separate inspection directory; do not import the old repository
history or its research corpus into current Gimble:

```sh
git clone --single-branch --branch codex/programmatic-workflow-research \
  /Users/tyler/src/gimble-history-backup-20260909.bundle \
  /private/tmp/gimble-go-poc-inspection
```

Relevant commits:

- `983ebc6bf57ca0a7d40a6b55d3daec0269861cbe`: initial Go POC.
- `13961c504bde31e2edd8e06f95e497ba4e110593`: frozen implementation recorded by
  the historical proof report.
- `ae7af1f56548ac866f99f21217b3754b32e15786`: separate workflow algorithms from
  input and prompt plumbing.
- `b04cd90d5a189dae8cf4dcaec60c740a27afb706`: ordinary-Go concurrency sketches.

In the recovered checkout, inspect `program/`, `cmd/tractor/program.go`,
and `ephemeral/projects/tractor/programmatic-workflows/POC.md`. The last file
records the original choices, invocation examples, limitations, and historical
live-run results. The referenced temporary proof artifacts no longer exist;
source recovery was verified, but those runtime results were not reverified.

## How to use this as the next starting point

Tyler's established authoring requests were Go iterators, visible ordinary
control flow, separate input/prompt plumbing, automatic scoped context, and
ordinary goroutines/errgroup for concurrency. The next sketches should build
from the recovered code and those requests. Keep the newer role/input/catalog
direction distinct from its rejected API spelling; none of its invented
identifiers is an accepted interface merely because it appears in the index.
