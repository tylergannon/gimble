description: Orchestrates an end-to-end multi-model delivery workflow — requirements interview, plan, critique, plan update, then a coding/validation/review loop — each role its own foreground Claude Code or Codex CLI process with per-role models and session resume. Use when the user invokes df-easy-loop-e2e or wants a governed, requirements-first build.

# df-easy-loop-e2e

You — the agent that invoked this skill — are the top-level orchestrator agent
in the workflow definition below. Follow it exactly; it is authoritative.

```yaml
# df-easy-loop-e2e workflow definition
#
# The orchestrator invokes the sub-agents defined below, in the order dictated by
# each agent's routing. It must not do the sub-agents' work itself and must not
# read into the sessions/artifacts the sub-agents produce, except for the
# explicit requirements-question handoff in top_level_agent.prompt.
#
# NOTE ON PROMPTS: each agent's `prompt_construction` is NOT handed to the
# sub-agent verbatim; it instructs the top-level agent how to build that
# sub-agent's prompt. Follow it carefully; do not invent new sentences.
#
# The top-level agent must not write software to manage this process, but instead
# manage the process itself. Run each coding-agent CLI in the foreground and wait
# for that process to exit. Do not return until the workflow reaches `end`,
# unless an invocation meets the explicit terminal-error definition below.

# How the top-level agent runs each model, and which CLI to use.
#
# PLACEHOLDER SUBSTITUTION (important): the `<...>` tokens in the templates below
# and in `base_prompt` are NOT shell variables. Before running a command, replace
# each token IN THE COMMAND TEXT with its literal, fully-resolved absolute path or
# value (expand `~` yourself). Do NOT introduce your own shell variables (e.g.
# $WORKING_DIR) for these; an undefined shell variable expands to an empty string
# and will silently produce a blank path. Verify the final command string contains
# no `<...>` tokens, no `$`-vars, and no empty operands before you run it.
#
# REASONING EFFORT: when an agent defines a `reasoning_effort:` field, substitute
# it into that CLI's effort flag (Claude Code: `--effort <reasoning_effort>`;
# Codex: `-c model_reasoning_effort="<reasoning_effort>"`). When the agent has NO
# `reasoning_effort` field, OMIT that entire effort flag so the model runs at its
# own default. Valid values: Codex = none|minimal|low|medium|high|xhigh|max;
# Claude Code = low|medium|high|xhigh|max.

top_level_agent:
  prompt: |
    You are the top-level orchestrator. Your responsibility is to invoke the other
    agents defined in this workflow. You must not do their work for them, and you
    should not look into the agent sessions or the artifacts the sub-agents create,
    except for the explicit requirements-question handoff below. Do not invent new
    sentences when constructing sub-agent prompts; follow each agent's
    `prompt_construction` carefully.

    Startup inputs:
      - claude_config_dir / codex_config_dir: if not provided, ask for each.
        Propose the defaults (`~/.claude`, `~/.codex`), and also look for
        existing `~/.claude*` / `~/.codex*` directories and offer them as
        options.
      - working_dir: tell the user the current working directory and ask whether
        that is where the work should happen; use their answer.

    Setup, at the start of the run:
      1. Create the run directory at `<run.root>/<YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS>` (per
         run.dir_format).
      2. Copy this skill's SKILL.md into `<run_dir>/<run.setup_dir>/`.
      3. Create `<run_dir>/<run.agents_dir>/` and, under it, one subdirectory per
         agent named with the agent's slug.
      4. Ensure codex_config_dir exists before any Codex invocation (mkdir -p);
         Codex will not create its config root.

    Begin the invocation loop with the `requirements` agent.

    For each agent invocation:
      1. One routed visit means exactly one CLI launch. Immediately before that
         launch, create the next zero-padded visit-number directory under the
         agent's subdirectory (`<run_dir>/agents/<slug>/<NNN>/`, starting at
         001). Do not launch the same logical visit a second time.
      2. Run the CLI command synchronously in the foreground. Do not append shell
         backgrounding, request a background agent, or enable Remote Control for
         the invocation. Wait for the exact launched process to exit before
         evaluating its artifacts or routing to another agent.
      3. Choose the CLI by the agent's model prefix (`claude-` -> Claude Code,
         `gpt-` -> Codex) and use the matching template in `clis`. Export the
         correct config-dir env var; set the working directory to <working_dir>.
         Substitute every placeholder per the PLACEHOLDER SUBSTITUTION rules in
         `clis`; before running, confirm the final command contains no `<...>`
         tokens, no `$`-vars, and no empty path operands.
      4. Build the agent's prompt by combining `base_prompt` with that agent's
         `prompt_construction`. Supply, in the prompt: the full path to the
         agent's visit directory, and the full path(s) to the artifact(s) it must
         read (per the agent's `reads`).
      5. After the process exits successfully, verify that the expected output
         artifact(s) and `outcome.yaml` exist. If anything appears absent, wait
         `run.artifact_recheck_interval_seconds` and recheck the same paths, up to
         `run.artifact_recheck_attempts` times; do not relaunch the agent. If
         anything is still absent after all rechecks, treat the invocation as a
         terminal orchestration error.
         A nonzero CLI exit or explicit CLI error event is also a terminal error.
         Do not infer that an exited process is still working in the background.
      6. Capture the CLI's session/thread id from its output and write it to
         `<visit_dir>/<run.session_id_file>`. If a successful invocation emits no
         id, write `unavailable` to the session-id file and proceed only when the
         agent's context is `empty`; for a `continue` agent, a missing id is a
         terminal orchestration error.
      7. If the agent's `context` is `continue` AND a session/thread id from a
         PRIOR visit of this same agent exists, invoke via the CLI's
         `resume_template` (Claude: `--resume <session_id>`; Codex:
         `codex exec ... resume <thread_id> "<PROMPT>"`). If `context` is `empty`,
         always start a fresh session. The first visit of any agent is always
         fresh.
      8. It is the sub-agent's responsibility to write `<run.outcome_file>` into
         its visit directory naming the agent to invoke next. Read only that file
         to decide routing.
      9. Requirements question handoff: if the `requirements` agent routes to
         `requirements`, verify `<visit_dir>/<run.question_file>` exists, read its
         contents exactly, present those contents to the user unmodified, and
         capture the user's response unmodified. Before the next `requirements`
         visit launches, write that exact response to
         `<next_visit_dir>/<run.user_response_file>` and supply that path in the
         next requirements-agent prompt. Do not summarize, rephrase, interpret, or
         sanitize either the question or the response.
      10. A visit is complete only when its expected output artifact(s) exist and
         its `outcome.yaml` contains one allowed `next` value. Read only
         `outcome.yaml` to route; checking the expected artifact's existence is
         allowed, but reading it is not, except for the requirements-question
         handoff above. Count one visit only after this logical visit completes;
         polling and confirmed pre-launch failures do not add visits. Enforce each
         agent's `max_visits_per_step`, or the global default, before following its route.
         If the cap has been reached, route to `end`. `end` is terminal and is not
         an agent slug; never try to invoke an `end` agent. Never put the
         visit-cap rule in any sub-agent's prompt.

# Combined with each agent's `prompt_construction` when calling that agent.
# Replace `<next_options>` with that agent's `next:` list, copied verbatim,
# comma-separated; never compose, abbreviate, or invent option names.
base_prompt: |
  You have been given a working (visit) directory; its full path is provided
  below. Read the input artifact(s) at the full path(s) provided below, do your
  task, and write your output artifact into your visit directory.

  A token cache (full project context) and semantic index are available: see
  `docs/SEMANTIC-INDEX.md` in the working directory for the token cache local
  path and the semantic index entrypoint.

  When you have completed your work, write `outcome.yaml` into your visit
  directory containing a single field `next:` set to the slug of the agent that
  should be invoked next, chosen from the options listed for you below.

  Your next options are: <next_options>

agents:

  # Entry point. It may ask the user questions only by writing question.md and
  # routing back to itself; the top-level agent handles the verbatim handoff.
  requirements:

      - validation-holdout.md
    next:
      - requirements
      - plan
    prompt_construction: |
      Tell the requirements agent its visit directory. If this invocation follows
      a question handoff, also supply the full path to `user-response.md`.
      Instruct it to have its subagents do focused recon of the codebase in the
      working directory (if one exists) before each question, to better
      understand the answers given so far; to ask at most one question per visit;
      and to produce `requirements.md` in its visit directory on every visit.
      When it needs an answer before finishing requirements, instruct it to write the exact question to `question.md` in
      its visit directory and write `outcome.yaml` with `next: requirements`.
      Every question must be multiple choice with lettered choices and include a
      `Z.` option for "No more questions, begin work." Instruct it to use any
      supplied `user-response.md` exactly as the outcome of its previous question.
      Instruct it to suggest validation criteria to the user: requirements-derived
      things that must be true for the work to be approved. It must keep those
      criteria in `validation-holdout.md` in its visit directory. Instruct it to
      store every question and every answer verbatim in `requirements.md`, and
      when requirements and validation criteria are complete, write `outcome.yaml`
      with `next: plan`.

  plan:
    model: claude-fable-5 # -> Claude Code

    reads:
      - requirements.md
    creates:
      - plan.md
    next:
      - plan-critique
    prompt_construction: |
      Tell the plan agent its visit directory and the full path to
      `requirements.md`. Instruct it to read `requirements.md` and produce
      `plan.md` in its visit directory. Instruct it to write the plan as Markdown
      checklist items using `- [ ]` task checkboxes. Its only next option is
      `plan-critique`.

  plan-critique:
    model: gpt-5.6-sol # -> Codex
    reasoning_effort: high
    context: empty
    reads:
      - plan.md
      - requirements.md
    creates:
      - plan-critique.md
    next:
      - plan-update
    prompt_construction: |
      Tell the plan-critique agent its visit directory and the full paths to
      `plan.md` and `requirements.md`. Instruct it to read `plan.md` and
      `requirements.md` and produce `plan-critique.md` in its visit directory. Its
      only next option is `plan-update`.

  plan-update:
    model: claude-opus-4-8 # -> Claude Code
    reasoning_effort: high
    context: empty
    reads:
      - requirements.md
      - plan.md
      - plan-critique.md
    creates:
      - updated-plan.md
    next:
      - coding
    prompt_construction: |
      Tell the plan-update agent its visit directory and the full paths to
      `requirements.md`, `plan.md`, and `plan-critique.md`. Instruct it to read
      those three and produce `updated-plan.md` (NOT `plan-update.md`) in its
      visit directory. Instruct it to preserve the plan as Markdown checklist
      items using only unchecked `- [ ]` task checkboxes. Its only next option is
      `coding`.
      Tell the agent to only include genuine improvements that derisk the project
      and make it more maintainable or well tested.

  coding:
    model: gpt-5.6-sol # -> Codex
    reasoning_effort: high
    context: continue
    reads:
      - updated-plan.md # latest review visit copy, otherwise plan-update output
      - requirements.md
      - review.md # reviewer's latest; only when returning from review
    creates:
      - coding-update.md
      - proposed-plan-checks.md
    next:
      - validation
    prompt_construction: |
      Tell the coding agent its visit directory and the full paths to
      `updated-plan.md` and `requirements.md`; use the latest `updated-plan.md`
      from a prior review visit when one exists, otherwise use the plan-update
      artifact. When this invocation follows a review, also supply the full path
      to the reviewer's latest `review.md`. Instruct it to choose a coherent
      subset of unchecked plan items for this visit, not necessarily the whole
      plan. It must not edit `updated-plan.md` or check any plan checkbox. It may
      propose completed boxes by writing `proposed-plan-checks.md` in its visit
      directory, listing the exact checklist item text it believes should be
      checked and the evidence for each. Instruct it to produce
      `coding-update.md` in its visit directory, test the software it writes, and
      run any tests that are part of the repo's standard test set. Instruct it to
      commit every change it makes, and to never use `git add` with wildcards or
      `-A` (add specific paths only). Its only next option is `validation`.

  validation:
    model: gpt-5.6-sol # -> Codex
    reasoning_effort: high
    context: empty
    reads:
      - requirements.md
      - validation-holdout.md
      - updated-plan.md # latest review visit copy, otherwise plan-update output
      - coding-update.md # latest coding visit
    creates:
      - validation.md
    next:
      - review
    prompt_construction: |
      Tell the validation agent its visit directory and the full paths to
      `requirements.md`, `validation-holdout.md`, the latest authoritative
      `updated-plan.md`, and the latest `coding-update.md`. Instruct it to
      produce `validation.md` in its visit directory. Instruct it that validation
      must run the software, not only inspect code or run unit tests. It should
      record the commands it ran, the relevant output, whether the running
      software behavior satisfies the requirements, and whether every
      validation-holdout criterion is met. If any validation-holdout criterion is
      not met, validation fails even when the other validation checks pass. Its
      only next option is `review`.

  review:
    model: claude-opus-4-8 # -> Claude Code
    reasoning_effort: high
    context: continue
    reads:
      - requirements.md
      - updated-plan.md
      - coding-update.md (ALL prior coding visits, not just the latest)
      - proposed-plan-checks.md # latest coding visit
      - validation.md # latest validation visit
    creates:
      - review.md
      - updated-plan.md
    next:
      - end
      - coding
    prompt_construction: |
      Tell the review agent its visit directory and the full paths to
      `requirements.md`, the latest authoritative `updated-plan.md`, every prior
      `coding-update.md` from all coding visits so far, the latest
      `proposed-plan-checks.md`, and the latest `validation.md`. Instruct it to
      read those and produce both `review.md` and `updated-plan.md` in its visit
      directory. It must copy the input `updated-plan.md` to its visit directory;
      review is the only agent allowed to check plan boxes, and the only edits it
      may make to that copy are changing Markdown checkbox markers from unchecked
      to checked for work it determines is complete. It may accept or reject the
      coding agent's proposed checked boxes. Instruct it to judge the work by
      completeness against the requirements, correctness, quality concerns from
      the validation step, and the results of its own testing. If the requirements
      are not all met, it must choose `coding` next so more work can be completed.
      If validation failed because validation-holdout criteria were not met, it
      must also choose `coding` next, regardless of whether the other validation
      checks or its own tests passed. In `review.md`, describe the work as
      incomplete and identify the missing required behavior, but do not mention
      the holdout set or holdout criteria. Its next options are `end` or `coding`.
      Also tell it the run directory's timestamp name. When it chooses `end`,
      it must copy its final `updated-plan.md` and `review.md` into
      `docs/plans/<run-timestamp>/` in the working directory and commit them
      with specific-path `git add`.
