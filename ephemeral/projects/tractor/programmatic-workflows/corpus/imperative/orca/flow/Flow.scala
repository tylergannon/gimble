/** Run `body` as a named, resumable, committing stage (ADR 0018 §2.1).
  *
  * The stage id is a path `parent/name#occurrence` (`occurrence` counts prior
  * same-named stages under the same parent frame). On resume, if the progress
  * log holds an entry for this id whose JSON decodes to `T`, the decoded value
  * is returned without running `body`; a decode failure (result type changed
  * under this id) falls through and re-runs. A fresh run appends a
  * `StageEntry(id, name, resultJson)`, force-adds the log, and commits — the
  * commit also `add -A`s code changes, so a stage yields one commit covering
  * code + progress.
  *
  * A nested stage's commit stages the whole tree, so it sweeps up any
  * uncommitted edits the outer stage's body made before the nesting point. If
  * the flow later fails, the outer stage re-runs against a tree already
  * containing its own partial work (committed under the inner stage's message)
  * — resume is only correct if the outer body is idempotent over its own
  * leftovers. Prefer doing edits inside their own stage rather than around a
  * nested one.
  *
  * A non-fatal failure in `body` emits an Error event once (`fail` and
  * malformed-output carry their own emission state) and re-raises. Fatal
  * throwables propagate unreported — they signal shutdown, not a stage outcome.
