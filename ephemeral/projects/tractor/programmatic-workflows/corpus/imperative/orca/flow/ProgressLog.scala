  * Both are `Option` with a `None` default under the SAME tolerant- decoding
  * exception as [[SessionRecord]]'s own optional fields (see [[ProgressLog]]'s
  * codec) — a log written before this field existed decodes with both `None`,
  * and the resume offer simply doesn't apply to it (an old in-flight run across
  * an orca upgrade still resumes; it just isn't one-keystroke). `flowName` is
  * separately `None` for a run started outside the shell (no `ORCA_FLOW_NAME`
  * to record) even on a freshly written header.
  *
  * `startingCommit` is the commit HEAD pointed at when the run bound its branch
  * — the diff base for a review of everything the whole run changed. It carries
  * the same `Option`/`None` tolerant-decoding exception, and unlike the fields
  * above it stays lenient on load: a header missing it, or carrying something
  * that isn't a commit hash, reads as absent rather than aborting the run
  * ([[RecoveryCheck.startingCommit]]). A fresh run always writes `Some`.

  * the author supplied, and — when the session is durably resumable — the wire
  * id to resume against.
  *
  * `id` is the stable client id the framework hands across calls;
  * [[SessionRecord.resumeWireId]] is the id to put on the wire when resuming
  * the live backend conversation (same `wireId` notion as
  * [[orca.backend.Dispatch]]). Its value depends on the backend:
  *   - codex/gemini/opencode: a backend-minted server-thread id (≠ `id`);
  *   - claude/pi: equal to `id` itself — both claim the id client-side and keep
  *     a durable transcript, so recording it re-claims the session (`--resume`
  *     / `--continue`) on a resumed run.
  *
  * Persisted so a resumed run can rehydrate the in-memory map, resume against
  * the right wire id, and reuse the same [[orca.agents.SessionId]] rather than
  * minting a second one. `resumeWireId` is `None` until a run learns it (see
  * `persistResumeWireId` in `orca.Session`).
  *
  * `backend` records the minting agent's [[orca.agents.BackendTag]] via its
  * stable [[orca.agents.BackendTag.wireName]] (frozen independently of the case
  * name), so targeted rehydration (`FlowLifecycle.rehydrateSessions`) knows
  * which agent to replay `resumeWireId` into rather than assuming the lead.
  * `None` when the minting agent carries no backend tag (a stub agent) — falls
  * back to the lead. A value matching no known `wireName` (an edited log) is
  * skipped with a warning rather than guessed (`FlowLifecycle.targetAgent`);
  * `agent.session(name, seed)`'s reuse arm self-heals a stale tag from a
  * lead-backend swap.
