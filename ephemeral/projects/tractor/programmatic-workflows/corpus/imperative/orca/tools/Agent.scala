  *
  *   - **`run(prompt)`** — one ephemeral free-text turn on a fresh

  *   - **`chat()`** — a fresh EPHEMERAL multi-turn conversation ([[Chat]]):
  *     in-run only, needs only `InStage` so it works inside a fork. Gone on
  *     crash/resume.
  *   - **`agent.session(name, seed)`** (a flow extension) — a DURABLE
  *     `orca.FlowSession` that survives a flow crash/resume: named, seeded, and
  *     persisted.
  *
  * Free text is always autonomous; `interactive` (a human steering the turn)
  * exists only under `resultAs[O]`, where the structured payload marks the
  * conversation's end.

  * Parameterized by the concrete `BackendTag` so session ids and results carry
  * the backend identity at the type level.

  * Several members below (`withRole`, `withCheapModel`, `withSelfManagedGit`,
