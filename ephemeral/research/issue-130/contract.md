# Issue 130: current implementation contract

Use OpenCode's native `session.*` event payload vocabulary for the supported
Gimble observations. Do not add a parallel custom vocabulary or runtime schema
validation of Gimble's own emitted events.

## Borrowed implementation

The authority is OpenCode revision
`c55ee2a8152603f04a409163bd3edf79c425fbd7`, particularly
`packages/client/src/solid/data.ts` and its matching event/message/inbox types
under `packages/schema/src/`. This newer revision has a native V2 UI; the older
standalone V2 reducer and legacy projection are not interchangeable with it.
The source is MIT, copyright 2025 opencode; retain its notices and source pin.

Port the event-application behavior used by Gimble, including authoritative
text/reasoning/tool finals. Preserve upstream handling of optional fields,
message identity, and ordering. OpenCode's separate HTTP cache-refill/read
orchestrator is not part of Gimble's observation reducer. The adapters serialize
same-type content blocks; overlapping same-type starts retain upstream's known
limitation, recorded by the oracle fixture.

The Go and browser reducers hold native message state. Go snapshots restore
that state in the browser. There are no read/completion obligations, generation
counters, reducer checkpoint APIs, or read/settle transport frames.

## Producer and storage boundary

Claude and Codex translate supported provider activity into native payloads.
Gimble assigns event IDs, timestamps, and stable ascending message IDs while
preserving provider references on emitted records. Unmapped provider traffic is
ignored. There is no separate native-audit log or unused durable aggregate
sequence/version field.

A live run owns its reduced observation. A project-local lookup connects live
runs to the page and HTTP routes. Finished runs leave that lookup after writing
one final snapshot outside the reduction lock. No periodic full-run checkpoint
writes occur on the event path, and no completed-run memory cache is retained.

## Browser delivery

SSR and the JSON route read current reduced state. Every SSE connection starts
with a complete snapshot replacing client state, then event/lifecycle updates.
Capture the snapshot and register the subscriber under the same lock. Subscriber
overflow closes the stream; reconnect starts fresh. No cursor recovery or
per-connection raw-log replay.

Use skgo's existing transport hook for SSR. Streamed content updates the affected
message instead of copying all transcript content. Runtime profiling machinery
is not part of the viewer; measurements belong in the proof harness.

## Evidence

The retained event fixtures are compared after every prefix with recorded output
from the untouched pinned JavaScript reducer. This proves those event paths,
not full OpenCode cache orchestration. `third_party/opencode/prepare.sh` and its
oracle runner reproduce upstream output without tracking downloaded sources.

Use the existing production-handler browser scenario for SSR, streaming text,
reasoning, tools, authoritative finals, and reconnect replacement. Delivery
results, measurements, and admitted adapter limitations are in
[DELIVERY.md](execution/DELIVERY.md). The original [SPRINT.md](SPRINT.md) is a
historical plan; this contract and subsequent explicit user instructions
supersede its extra infrastructure and verification requirements.
